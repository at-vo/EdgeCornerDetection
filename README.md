* See Report for Results 
#### Separable Convolution:
refers to breaking down a convolution kernel into lower dimension kernels. In this case a 2D Gaussian kernel is seperated into two 1D kernels. 

#### Canny Edge Detection algorithm:
Calculate Gradient Magnitude -> Non-max suppression -> Hysteresis Thresholding

#### Harris Corner algorithm:
spatial derivative calculation -> structure tensor setup -> corner response calculation -> Non-max suppression
